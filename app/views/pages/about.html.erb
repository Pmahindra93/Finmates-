          <br>

        <p>Finmates' vision is to become the Bloomberg for millennials, providing digestible news and education pieces to make sound investment decisions 💸📈. <br><br>

        At Finmates, we are incredibly driven & passionate about making financial information more accessible to all. According to a survey conducted by Investopedia and Pew Research Center, only 37% of millennials feel knowledgeable about investing at all. This percentage drops down even further when it comes to cryptocurrency. We want to tackle that by introducing Finmates to the market 🤩. <br><br>

        At launch, Finmates will purely focus on crypto insights as we see the trend shifting to a digital and decentralized financial environment. You’ve probably heard or read about cryptocurrencies, and blockchains, and all kinds of terms in that space. But do you really understand what’s going on? And if so, can you actually see through the jungle of all the different platforms, podcasts, tweets, YouTube channels, etc.❓ <br><br>

        Don’t get us wrong, we are no experts on this matter! It's frustrating to see the lack of easy-to-understand resources on cryptocurrency. We want to build a community that shares information and knowledge as members try to navigate the crypto world! 🕵 <br><br>

        That said, we dare to envisage to be your one-stop-shop for information, updates, and, of course, fun stuff surrounding cryptocurrencies. Much like ALDI might be your one-stop grocery shop, we’d like to build an independent platform, where you happily shop for your crypto insights 🛍 🛒. <br><br>

        The first step on our self-imposed mission is to build and develop this cool app to help others – and ourselves – understand what is happening in this “new” and "crazy" world of crypto by providing bite-sized snacks for your consumption 🍿, without all the complicated, fancy words 🙅. <br><br>

        Eventually, we hope to excite others about cryptocurrencies and all that it may entail. We hope you jump on board 🚀.</p>
